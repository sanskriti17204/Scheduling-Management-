## Schedule Management System: Overview and Functionality

The goal of this project is to develop  a **command-line interface (CLI) Schedule Management System** to be developed in **C++ language**. The system is designed to streamline the management of training schedules, catering to the distinct needs of two primary user roles: **Administrators** and **Faculty**.



### Administrator Functionality

The Administrator role is central to the system's operation, with comprehensive control over training schedules. Once logged in with unique credentials, an Admin can perform the following key tasks:

* **Create New Training Schedules:** Admins can meticulously define new training sessions by inputting details such as:
    * Technology covered
    * Unique Batch ID
    * Start and end dates for the batch
    * Assigned faculty details
    * Venue information
    * Number of participants
* **Modify Existing Schedules:** The system empowers Admins to easily update or alter any aspect of a previously created training schedule.
* **Allocate Trainers:** Admins are responsible for assigning specific training schedules to appropriate trainers.
* **Generate Training Reports:** A crucial reporting feature allows Admins to generate monthly reports of trainings, filtered by a specific stream (e.g., technology area).
* **Quit Application:** Admins can exit the application at any time.

### Faculty Functionality

The Faculty role provides essential capabilities for trainers to manage their assigned sessions. After logging in, a Faculty member can:

* **View Assigned Schedules:** Faculty can quickly retrieve detailed information about all training schedules allocated to them.
* **Cancel Training Sessions:** Faculty members have the ability to request the cancellation of a specific training session they are assigned to.
* **Quit Application:** Faculty can exit the application, with the system ensuring any active data is saved.

In essence, this system aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for managing training schedules, ensuring efficient operations for both administrators and faculty members.
